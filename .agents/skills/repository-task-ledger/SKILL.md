# Repository Task Ledger

Manage explicitly opted-in implementation work as versioned repository state
that can move across devices, people, agents, and worktrees. This is a
coordination protocol, not a distributed lock.

## Admit Work

- Create a new task only after the user invokes `task-new`. Ordinary requests
  remain task-free regardless of size, duration, or changed paths. An agent may
  suggest `task-new`, but must not invoke it or make it a prerequisite.
- After opt-in, admit only accepted outcomes that will change at least one file
  outside the owning repository's `tasks/**`. Source, tests, docs, config,
  workflows, scripts, instructions, skills, and new tracked files all count.
- Do not admit read-only work, planning, review, validation-only work,
  external-only operations, or task-ledger maintenance.
- Once a task exists, manage it until completion, abandonment, or explicit
  handoff. The opt-in rule does not release existing ownership.

For cross-repository work, the repository owning the primary design and
implementation owns the source task. Generated files, installed copies, and
lockfile refreshes remain part of that task. Create linked tasks only where
another repository owns independent design, adaptation, tests, or config;
never copy one task between repositories.

## Prepare Task Work

1. Read the repository's agent instructions and `tasks/README.md`; local policy
   may refine this skill.
2. Run `repoledger doctor` before claiming or resuming when the repository has
   adopted the CLI. It must refresh the shared branch, validate full history,
   and validate the worktree identity; `--offline` is insufficient.
3. Inspect all backlog and ongoing tasks for duplicates, overlap, and ownership.
4. Preserve unrelated changes and never move another identity's task to clear
   a conflict.

The authoritative identity is the lowercase kebab-case value of
`task-ledger.identity` in worktree-scoped Git config. It requires
`extensions.worktreeConfig=true` and a matching
`tasks/ongoing/<identity>/.gitkeep` on the refreshed shared primary branch.
Never infer it or fall back to `task-ledger.defaultIdentity`; that global value
is only an initialization suggestion. If setup is missing, follow the
[adoption guide](./references/adoption.md) before task work.

Run `repoledger check` after task-artifact changes and in CI. The CLI validates
facts but never decides admission, ownership, acceptance, or lifecycle state,
and it never mutates task state. Without the CLI, apply the same checks in this
skill and the repository profile.

## Publish Milestones

The repository profile names the shared remote, primary branch, and normal
direct-push, merge, or pull-request path. Accepted task work authorizes routine
non-force commits and publication through that path; do not ask permission
solely for those steps.

Before each publication, refresh the remote, reconcile concurrent work without
discarding it, run focused checks, publish, and verify the commit is reachable
from the refreshed remote primary branch. Local commits, side branches, and
unmerged pull requests are not published milestones.

Authentication, branch protection, required review, failed validation, push
rejection, and conflicts remain real blockers. Never force-push around them.
Record the blocker and exact next action in `Progress.md`, then ask only for the
required user action.

Every completed task has at least three distinct integrations:

1. **Claim:** task moved to the current identity before implementation.
2. **Implementation complete:** implementation and evidence published while
   the task is still ongoing.
3. **Archive:** completed task moved to `tasks/archived/` as a separate final
   integration.

Never combine claim with implementation completion or implementation
completion with archive publication.

## Create And Claim

After `task-new` intake and admission:

1. Create `tasks/backlog/<task-name>/Task.md` from the
   [task template](./assets/Task.md). Record the accepted goal, scope,
   constraints, and observable acceptance criteria rather than a transcript.
2. Keep Issues or another external tracker available for open intake and link
   it bidirectionally when possible.
3. Refresh the shared branch and recheck all backlog and ongoing tasks.
4. Move the whole folder with `git mv` to
   `tasks/ongoing/<identity>/<task-name>`.
5. Create `Progress.md` from the [progress template](./assets/Progress.md),
   record current state and next action, and apply the move checks below.
6. Commit only the claim artifacts, publish them, and verify the claim before
   substantive implementation.

## Work And Coordinate

- Keep `Task.md` durable; put chronology, current state, decisions, validation,
   blockers, checklist state, and the next concrete action in `Progress.md`.
- Publish meaningful validated checkpoints with current progress evidence. Do
   not publish known-broken work merely to create a checkpoint.
- Keep task-specific research with the task. Put only stable project consensus
   in `docs/`.
- Never store credentials, tokens, private keys, private customer data, or
   machine-local secrets in task artifacts.

A claim advertises intent but is not a lock. If another task overlaps, stop
before expanding the implementation, refresh the shared branch, compare scope
and state, coordinate ownership or sequencing, record the resolution, and
preserve both actors' work.

## Verify Every Move

After a claim, handoff, archive, abandonment, or layout migration:

1. Verify the destination contains every artifact.
2. Verify the source task directory is gone. Remove it only when empty; stop if
    unexpected files remain.
3. Count non-hidden task directories across backlog, every ongoing identity,
    and archive, including empty directories. The task must appear exactly once.

Never copy tasks between positions. Preserve identity `.gitkeep` files.

## Run User Acceptance

Require manual acceptance only when a criterion depends on user judgment,
user-only access, physical interaction, or another result the agent cannot
verify. Otherwise do not invent a confirmation gate.

When required, create `UserAcceptance.md` from the
[template](./assets/UserAcceptance.md) with exact prerequisites, numbered
actions, expected results, and an unambiguous reporting method. Publish it with
implementation completion and keep the task ongoing. Record only the result
the user reports. On failure, record the observation, fix and republish, then
repeat acceptance. On success, archive without requesting another routine Git
confirmation.

## Handoff

Update `Progress.md`, verify the destination identity is registered, move the
whole task to `tasks/ongoing/<new-identity>/<task-name>`, apply the move checks,
and publish the handoff before either identity continues.

## Complete Or Abandon

To complete:

1. Finish all agent-verifiable criteria, run focused validation, and update
   `Task.md` and `Progress.md` with actual results.
2. Publish implementation completion while the task remains ongoing and verify
   it on the refreshed remote branch.
3. Complete any required user acceptance. Mark `Completed` only after every
   required criterion passes.
4. Mark archive publication as the final checklist action, move the whole task
   to `tasks/archived/<task-name>`, apply the move checks, then commit, publish,
   and verify this separate final integration.

To abandon, record the reason, useful findings, validation state, and follow-up
in `Progress.md`; set `Abandoned`, archive, and publish. Do not claim
implementation completion for unfinished work.

Archived tasks have no identity layer; Git history preserves prior ownership.

## Link Task Artifacts

Use `/path/from/repository/root` only when the repository profile declares that
all supported renderers resolve it. Otherwise use portable file-relative links
and update them when tasks move. Preserve external and fragment-only links, and
never couple local links to a machine path, repository owner, remote, or branch.

## Canonical Layout

```text
tasks/
|-- backlog/
|   `-- <task-name>/
|       `-- Task.md
|-- ongoing/
|   `-- <identity>/
|       |-- .gitkeep
|       `-- <task-name>/
|           |-- Task.md
|           |-- Progress.md
|           `-- UserAcceptance.md  # only when manual acceptance is required
`-- archived/
   `-- <task-name>/
      |-- Task.md
      |-- Progress.md
      `-- UserAcceptance.md      # preserved when one was required
```
