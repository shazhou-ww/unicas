# Publish npm package

Publish an allowlisted workspace package through this repository's protected
tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow. Never publish directly from the
development machine.

## Safety boundary

- Run this workflow only after the user explicitly invokes `/publish`. Natural
  language discussion about versions or releases is not an invocation.
- Read the repository instructions and
  [`docs/npm-package-releases.md`](../../../docs/npm-package-releases.md) before
  changing a manifest, creating a tag, rerunning a workflow, or troubleshooting
  a release.
- Treat `scripts/prepare-npm-release.mjs` as the allowlist and release-key
  authority. Do not derive a package path from user text.
- Publish only through `.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml`. Never run
  `npm publish` locally and never create or request `NPM_TOKEN` or
  `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Release versions and `npm/<release-key>/v<version>` tags are immutable. Never
  move, delete, or recreate a release tag to repair source or validation.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes. Stop if they prevent an isolated,
  reviewable release commit.

## Resolve the release

1. Resolve the release key from the invocation. When omitted and exactly one
   package is allowlisted, use that key; otherwise ask for the key.
2. Resolve one explicit version intent: `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or an exact
   canonical SemVer. Use stable SemVer unless the user explicitly requests a
   named prerelease channel.
3. Read the package manifest, current npm versions, existing release tags, and
   the latest package-specific release tag. Calculate the target from the
   highest relevant stable version rather than assuming the working manifest is
   already published.
4. Fetch `origin/main` and tags. Require the release worktree to be reconciled
   with current `origin/main` before preparing the release.
5. Stop if the target npm version or exact release tag already exists. Report
   the immutable existing release rather than attempting to replace it.

## Prepare and publish the release commit

1. Update the selected package's `version` in `package.json` and synchronize
   exact-version installation examples, version assertions, and generated
   lockfile metadata that belong to the same release.
2. Do not add unrelated feature work to a release-only change. If unreleased
   implementation is already integrated on `main`, the version commit may
   contain only release metadata and release-skill maintenance.
3. Run:

   ```sh
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm check
   pnpm --filter <package-name> pack:check
   pnpm check:skills
   git diff --check
   ```

4. Confirm the packed candidate has the requested package name and version and
   contains only the allowlisted files.
5. Commit the validated version change on `main`, push it through the normal
   non-force path, refresh `origin/main`, and verify the full commit is reachable
   from that branch. Do not tag an unpublished local commit or side branch.

## Create the release instruction

1. Fetch `origin/main` and tags again immediately before tagging.
2. Require a clean worktree, local `HEAD` equal to `origin/main`, an absent
   target tag, and an absent npm target version.
3. Run the release planner locally against the exact candidate:

   ```sh
   node scripts/prepare-npm-release.mjs \
     --tag npm/<release-key>/v<version> \
     --commit <full-origin-main-commit>
   ```

4. Create the immutable tag at the refreshed primary branch and push only that
   tag:

   ```sh
   git tag npm/<release-key>/v<version> origin/main
   git push origin refs/tags/npm/<release-key>/v<version>
   ```

The tag is the release instruction. Do not run a second publication command.

## Verify GitHub Actions and npm

1. Locate the `Publish npm package` run whose ref is the exact release tag and
   whose commit is the tagged `origin/main` commit. Do not mistake an older run
   for this release.
2. Follow the run to completion with GitHub CLI or the Actions API. If the npm
   environment requires a human reviewer, report that exact pending gate and
   wait rather than bypassing it.
3. Require the workflow conclusion to be `success`. Capture its run URL and
   immutable database ID.
4. Query npm for the exact package version and verify the stable `latest`
   dist-tag or requested named prerelease dist-tag points to it. Report the
   package version, release commit, tag, workflow URL, and registry result.

## Failure handling

- For a transient infrastructure or registry failure before publication,
  rerun the same workflow run without changing the tag.
- For source, manifest, or validation defects, leave the failed version and tag
  immutable. Fix the source on `main`, choose a new version, and create a new
  tag only after validation.
- If the registry shows the exact version even though workflow reporting is
  ambiguous, treat npm as immutable published state and investigate before any
  rerun.
- Authentication, tag protection, environment approval, branch protection, or
  failed validation are real blockers. Never bypass them with force pushes,
  local publication, or credentials routed through chat.
