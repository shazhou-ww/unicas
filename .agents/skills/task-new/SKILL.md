# New Repository Task

Use this entry only after explicit user invocation. Never invoke it because
work appears large or long-running. Lifecycle rules belong to
`repository-task-ledger`.

## Load The Core

Load `repository-task-ledger` by name, then the repository's agent instructions
and task profile. If the core is unavailable, stop and request the complete
skill package. Do not reconstruct it, invent a substitute, or change task
state.

## Record The Candidate

1. If the user did not explicitly invoke `task-new`, stop before reading or
   changing the ledger. Ordinary requests, discussion, and agent suggestions
   are not invocations.
2. Resolve the candidate from the latest explicit direction and settled
   conversation outcome. Command text is optional and overrides older context;
   do not ask the user to restate one clear outcome.
3. Identify the owning repository, one testable outcome, important boundaries,
   and observable acceptance criteria. Invocation counts as acceptance only
   when the candidate is sufficiently specified and passes core admission.
4. Populate the task template's human review checkpoints for this specific
   outcome. Scope alignment and delivery acceptance are always required. Mark
   interface, business and data model, and architecture review as `Required`,
   `Not applicable` with a reason, or `Assess during execution` with the
   decision trigger. Name the expected reviewer or role, concrete review
   artifact, and approval gate. Do not ask for every approval during intake;
   unresolved design details belong at their planned execution checkpoint.
   Acceptance of the candidate for the backlog is not scope approval.
5. Use `repoledger status` when available to inventory active positions, then
   read only definitions that plausibly match the candidate. The CLI supplies
   positions, not semantic duplicate judgment. Ignore unrelated claims, dirty
   files, and surface overlap during intake. If a match exists, ask whether to
   merge context or create a distinct task; do not mutate either route until
   the user decides.
6. Apply core admission and ask only for the smallest missing decision. Keep
   rejected, duplicate, unconfirmed, and task-free requests outside the ledger.
   For admitted work, use the core template and profile, then run
   `repoledger check --task <task-name>` when available before publication.

Finish by reporting whether the candidate was admitted and whether it was
merged or created. When created, include the task's canonical backlog path and
published state. Do not claim or implement the task unless the user explicitly
changes the intent to execution.
